Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a theory-motivated range of computational techniques for the automatic analysis and representation of human language.[1]Since its inception in 1950s, NLP research has been focusing on tasks such as machine translation, information retrieval, text summarization, question answering, information extraction, topic modeling, and more recently, opinion mining.[1]

NLP constitutes a core interest in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science. NLP studies comprise theories and methods that enable effective communication between humans and computers in natural language. As a scientific field of study, NLP assimilates computer science, linguistics, and mathematics with a primary goal of translating human (or natural) language into commands that can be executed by computers. NLP consists of two research directions: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG).[2]

The principal mission of NLU is to comprehend the natural language (human language) (Schank,1972) by deciphering documents and extracting valuable information for downstream tasks. 
Conceptual dependency is a theory of natural language understanding that was introduced by Roger Schank and his colleagues in the 1970s. According to this theory, the meaning of a sentence is represented in terms of the concepts and relations that are expressed by the sentence.

The main idea behind conceptual dependency is that people understand language by building mental structures that represent the underlying meaning of what they hear or read. These mental structures are called conceptual dependency representations, or CDs for short.

CDs are composed of conceptual nodes that represent basic concepts and conceptual arcs that represent relationships between concepts. The nodes and arcs are linked together to form a network that captures the overall meaning of the sentence.

For example, consider the sentence "John gave the book to Mary". The CD representation of this sentence would consist of three nodes ("John", "book", and "Mary") and two arcs ("gave" and "to"). The arc labeled "gave" connects the "John" node to the "book" node, indicating that John was the giver and the book was the gift. The arc labeled "to" connects the "book" node to the "Mary" node, indicating that Mary was the recipient of the gift.

Conceptual dependency theory has been influential in the development of natural language processing and computational linguistics. It has also been used as a framework for developing expert systems and other forms of artificial intelligence that can reason about the meaning of natural language sentences.[3]

In contrast, NLG is the production of text in natural languages that are understandable by humans based on the provision of structured data, text, graphics, audio,and video, (McDonald, 2010).[4]
The Handbook of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a comprehensive reference book that covers various aspects of natural language processing, including the fundamental concepts, methods, techniques, and applications of NLP. It is intended for researchers, practitioners, and students who are interested in NLP and its related fields.

The book is divided into several sections that cover different topics related to NLP. The first section provides an introduction to NLP, including its history, current state-of-the-art, and future directions. The second section covers the basic concepts and techniques of NLP, such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic analysis.

The third section covers advanced topics in NLP, such as machine translation, discourse analysis, and natural language generation. The fourth section covers applications of NLP, such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and question answering.[4]

NLG can be further divided into three categories: textto-text (Genest & Lapalme, 2011), such as translation and abstract;
text-to-other, such as text-generated images (Xu et al., 2018); and other to text (other-to-Text), such as video-generated text (Rohrbach et al., 2013).[2]

The "Framework for Abstractive Summarization using Text-to-Text Generation" is a research paper presented at the Workshop on Monolingual Text-To-Text Generation, held at the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2011. The paper proposes a framework for generating abstractive summaries of documents using a text-to-text generation approach.

The proposed framework consists of three main components: a preprocessor, a generator, and a post-processor. The preprocessor analyzes the input document and extracts important information, such as key concepts, entities, and events. The generator then uses this information to generate a summary of the document in natural language. Finally, the post-processor applies a set of linguistic and stylistic rules to the summary to improve its coherence, fluency, and readability.

The generator component of the framework is based on a text-to-text generation approach, which involves transforming the input text into an intermediate representation that is then transformed into the output text. The intermediate representation is a structured representation of the important information extracted by the preprocessor, which is used to generate the summary.

The paper presents an evaluation of the framework using a dataset of news articles. The results show that the framework is effective in generating summaries that capture the key information of the input documents and are readable and coherent.

Overall, the proposed framework provides a promising approach to improving the effectiveness of automatic summarization systems, and has the potential to be applied to a wide range of domains where text summarization is needed.[5]

The paper "AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks" was presented at the 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. The paper proposes a novel approach for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions using attentional generative adversarial networks (GANs).

The proposed model, called AttnGAN, utilizes an attention mechanism to align the input text with the corresponding image features at multiple scales. This allows the model to generate high-resolution images that capture fine-grained details specified in the input text. AttnGAN also incorporates a conditional GAN to ensure that the generated images are semantically consistent with the input text.

The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of AttnGAN using several standard datasets for text-to-image generation. The results show that AttnGAN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality, diversity, and fidelity to the input text.

Overall, AttnGAN represents a significant advance in the field of text-to-image generation, providing a powerful and flexible approach that can be used in a wide range of applications, such as generating realistic images from textual descriptions for use in video games, virtual reality, and other visual media.[6]

"Grounding Action Descriptions in Videos" is a research paper that was presented at the European Conference on Computer Vision in 2016. The paper proposes a new approach for grounding natural language action descriptions in video data, which involves identifying the temporal and spatial regions of the video that correspond to the action being described.

The proposed approach is based on a deep neural network architecture that combines visual and textual information to perform action localization. The architecture consists of two main components: a visual feature extractor and a language model. The visual feature extractor is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to extract visual features from video frames. The language model is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is trained to encode natural language action descriptions into a fixed-length vector representation.

The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach using several standard datasets for action localization. The results demonstrate that the approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy and speed.

Overall, the proposed approach represents a significant advance in the field of action localization, providing a powerful and flexible approach that can be used in a wide range of applications, such as video analysis and surveillance, human-robot interaction, and autonomous driving.[7]
